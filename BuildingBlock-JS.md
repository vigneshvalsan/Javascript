# 1. DataTypes
 DataTypes are divided into primitive DataTypes and Composite DataTypes in JS
 PRIMITIVE DT
   Numbers- integers,floats and NAN(Not a Number), inifinity
   strings- "hello world"/'hello world'
   boolean- binary value TRUE Or FALSE 
   null- represent no value i.e you have assigned a variable with Null value i.e var a = NULL
   undefined- this means we have defined a variable but not initialized a value i.e var a /* but the variable a has not been initailized with a value*/
 COMPOSITE DT
    Objects
    Arrays
    Functions
# 2.Variables
    the first character must be a letter or underscore
    var a = 10          var n (undefined)
    var a = "string"    var n =3.14(float)
    var a = TRUE
    depending upon the value the datatypes are determined at the memory level during compilation
    that y JS is known light-weight scripting language
 # ESCAPE Sequence  
   if we want to use escape sequence like /n newlline we need to define a pre tag before script tag
 # concatenation and constant
   we can do concatenation with the help of '+' operator;
   constant can be defined by const a = 10;
